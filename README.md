# Developer Portfolio

This is my developer portfolio built with **React**. It showcases my web and software development projects (big and small), provides an about section, and includes a contact form for recruiters and collaborators to get in touch.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Main framework for building the UI.
- **React Router**: Handles client-side routing between pages.
- **Bootstrap**: For basic responsive layout and utility classes.
- **EmailJS**: Enables sending emails directly from the contact form without a backend.
- **Custom CSS**: For layout, theming, and component styling.
- **Vite** or **Create React App**: (Depending on your setup) for local development and build tooling.

## Routing

- `/` â€” Home

## Contact Form
